Currently, this is an implementation of the [Codenames](http://codenamesgame.com/) board game board.
We use it to display the board on a TV so that everyone can see it better.

You can find it running [here](http://wheerd.github.io/), but you will still need the board game to play.
Alternatively, you can use the offcial app to generate the spymaster card.
